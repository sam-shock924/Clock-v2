**Summary**
  
  Ah yes, the start of many a Software Developers' journey! At the time of its conception, creating a digital clock felt like a massive accomplishment! The first functioning application to start my portfolio. Looking back at it _6 months later_, it may seem very small but it's still a big pat on the back and it will always show my roots as I progress through this programmer life.
